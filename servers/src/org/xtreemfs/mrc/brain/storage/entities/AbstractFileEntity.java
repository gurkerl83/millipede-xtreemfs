 * The abstract file entity is the base class for file and directory entities.

 * is mandatory and frequently used. File metadata that is only assigned to
 * certain files is stored in the form of meta attributes, such as a target
 * reference in case the file is a symbolic link.
 *
 * The abstract file entity encapsulates all data that files and directories
 * have in common, such as a name, POSIX timestamps or an ACL.
