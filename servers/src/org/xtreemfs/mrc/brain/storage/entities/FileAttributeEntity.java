/**
 * This class encapsulates data of a file attribute in the database. File
 * attributes are used to store additional data about files, such as
 * user-defined extended metadata or other file metadata which is not stored in
 * file or directory entities.
 *
 * There is a many-to-one relationship between files and file attributes; a file
 * may have multiple attributes, and each file attribute entity belongs to a
 * single file which is identified by the 'fileId' field.
 *
 * A file attribute has a key and a value. In the scope of a file, the key
 * uniquely identifies the attribute. The value holds the attribute data.
 *
 * A file attribute may be either of type 'SYSTEM' or 'USER'. System attributes
 * are used for storing file metadata that is not part of the file entity or
 * directory entity describing the file itself, such as a reference for a
 * symbolic link or a striping policy string. User attributes are used for
 * storing extended user metadata, such as annotations describing the file
 * content.
