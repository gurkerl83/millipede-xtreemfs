13-AUG-2009 version 1.0 release
	* read-only replication working

24-AUG-2009
	* fcntl lock support (on OSD)
	* switched to MRC supplied inode/dev numbers by default
          Some applications (e.g. Dovecot) use the inode number to
          identify fds pointing to the same file. This does not work
          with "local" inode numbers assigned by fuse.
	* updated the BabuDB release
          fixed a problem with manual checkpoint creation
	* hostname used by MRC can be set with hostname property in config file
	  Necessary if the FQDN is not set/returned correctly on that host.
	* OSDs run on Windows

03-SEP-2009
	* DIR service uses new on-disk format which is independent of the
          protocol version.
	* MRC database format changed (USE DUMP/RESTORE WHEN UPDATING FROM 1.0)
	  compeletely redesigned the policies. There is now only one type of
	  policies for OSD selection and replica creation/selection
