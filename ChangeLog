13-AUG-2009 version 1.0 release
	* read-only replication working

24-AUG-2009
	* fcntl lock support (on OSD)
	* switched to MRC supplied inode/dev numbers by default
          Some applications (e.g. Dovecot) use the inode number to
          identify fds pointing to the same file. This does not work
          with "local" inode numbers assigned by fuse.
	* updated the BabuDB release
          fixed a problem with manual checkpoint creation
	* hostname used by MRC can be set with hostname property in config file
	  Necessary if the FQDN is not set/returned correctly on that host.
	* OSDs run on Windows
	
03-SEP-2009
	* DIR service uses new on-disk format which is independent of the
          protocol version.
	* MRC database format changed (USE DUMP/RESTORE WHEN UPDATING FROM 1.0)
	  compeletely redesigned the policies. There is now only one type of
	  policies for OSD selection and replica creation/selection
	
15-SEP-2009
    * added on-close replication support
    	Replicas can now be automatically created when a file is closed
    	after having been written the first time. This causes the file
    	to become read-only. The behavior of on-close replication can
    	be controlled via the xtfs_repl tool.
	* fixed SSL problems on Windows
    * added support for user authentication based on gridmap files
	* improved client performance by eliminating unnecessary system calls
	* data cache now uses stripe size instead of system page size
	* fixed bugs #38, #41, #42, #43, #45, #49
	
16-SEP-2009 version 1.1 release
	* fixed bugs #51, #52, #53
	* added notification mechanism to DIR that sends notification mails to
	  an admin if an OSD or MRC has failed

05-NOV-2009
	* added GRID SSL mode
	  When enabled (requires SSL to be enable too), XtreemFS will fall back to
          plain TCP after a successful SSL handshake. Enabled in services with
          "ssl.grid_ssl=true" in the config file. Client requires certificates
          and oncrpcg:// scheme when mounting.
