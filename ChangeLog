13-AUG-2009 version 1.0 release
	* read-only replication working

24-AUG-2009
	* fcntl lock support (on OSD)
	* switched to MRC supplied inode/dev numbers by default
          Some applications (e.g. Dovecot) use the inode number to
          identify fds pointing to the same file. This does not work
          with "local" inode numbers assigned by fuse.
	* updated the BabuDB release
          fixed a problem with manual checkpoint creation
	* hostname used by MRC can be set with hostname property in config file
	  Necessary if the FQDN is not set/returned correctly on that host.
	* OSDs run on Windows
	
03-SEP-2009
	* DIR service uses new on-disk format which is independent of the
          protocol version.
	* MRC database format changed (USE DUMP/RESTORE WHEN UPDATING FROM 1.0)
	  compeletely redesigned the policies. There is now only one type of
	  policies for OSD selection and replica creation/selection
	
15-SEP-2009
    * added on-close replication support
    	Replicas can now be automatically created when a file is closed
    	after having been written the first time. This causes the file
    	to become read-only. The behavior of on-close replication can
    	be controlled via the xtfs_repl tool.
	* fixed SSL problems on Windows
    * added support for user authentication based on gridmap files
	* improved client performance by eliminating unnecessary system calls
	* data cache now uses stripe size instead of system page size
	* fixed bugs #38, #41, #42, #43, #45, #49
	
16-SEP-2009 version 1.1 release
	* fixed bugs #51, #52, #53
	* added notification mechanism to DIR that sends notification mails to
	  an admin if an OSD or MRC has failed

26-OCT-2009
	* Linux binaries for mounting, creating, removing and listing volumes have
		been renamed, in order to be more consistent with Linux conventions

04-NOV-2009
	* If an admin password is set, server status pages are now password-protected.

05-NOV-2009
	* added GRID SSL mode
	  When enabled (requires SSL to be enable too), XtreemFS will fall back to
          plain TCP after a successful SSL handshake. Enabled in services with
          "ssl.grid_ssl=true" in the config file. Client requires certificates
          and oncrpcg:// scheme when mounting.

25-NOV-2009
	* MRC and OSD wait up to 30s (or as long as defined in startup.wait_for_dir)
          for the DIR during start-up.
	* added xctl: a script to start and stop the XtreemFS services
	* mount.xtreemfs checks for successfull mount before going into background
	* fixed the return value for xattr calls which caused problems with the
		Mac OS X Finder

27-NOV-2009
	* client caches file size updates by default (flushed on close, fsync)
	* OSD and MRC status pages can be used to get full stack traces (/strace)

03-DEC-2009
	* capability timeout is now a config option for the MRC
		(capability_timeout), default is 600s.
	* MRC dump/restore are now asynchronous. Backups of the MRC can be done
		without interrupting regular operations.
	* closest replicas of a file can now be selected based on Vivaldi
		coordinates (see User Guide)
	* fixed bugs #36, #54, #57, #58, #59, #60, #64, #66, #77, #78, #80, #81,
		#82, #83 #96, #97

07-DEC-2009
	* java client for XtreemFS (interface is still unstable!) in package org.xtreemfs.common.clients
	* experimental hadoop FileSystem driver for XtreemFS (in trunk/contrib/hadoop)

08-DEC-2009
	* added web-based admin console (in trunk/contrib/console)

09-DEC-2009
    * added per-file block size (st_blksize) to struct Stat;
        used by cp to determine I/O buffer sizes on Linux
        
11-DEC-2009
    * version 1.2. release

16-DEC-2009
    *fixed issue #109

08-JAN-2010
    * status of servers can now be set by admins (online, offline, etc.)
    * scrubber now removes dead replicas and creates new ones, marks full replicas as complete if needed

13-JAN-2010
    * fixed issues #55 and #75
    * added UUID-based OSD selection policy to default policies

22-JAN-2010
    * added client support for Fedora 12
9-FEB-2010
    * when deciding which OSD to contact to recalculate their position, nodes now choose
      more frequently the OSDs that are closer.
