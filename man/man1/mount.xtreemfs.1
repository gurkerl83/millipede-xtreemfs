.TH mount.xtreemfs 1 "July 2011" "The XtreemFS Distributed File System" "XtreemFS client"
.SH NAME
mount.xtreemfs \- mounts an XtreemFS volume
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBmount.xtreemfs [\fIoptions\fB] [oncrpc[s]://]\fIdirhost\fR[:\fIport\fR]/\fIvolume mountpoint
.br

.SH DESCRIPTION
.I mount.xtreemfs
mounts the volume \fIvolume\fR registered at the Directory Service \fIdirhost\fR:\fIport\fR to the local directory \fImountpoint\fR. \fImount.xtreemfs\fR is implemented as a FUSE user-level file system driver. Other than in-kernel drives, it operates as a detached process per mount point. 

.SH EXAMPLE USAGE
.B "mount.xtreemfs remote.dirservice.machine/MyVolume /mnt"

.SH OPTIONS

.TP
GENERAL OPTIONS:
.TP
\fB\-d/\-\-debug/\-\-log\-level \fIEMERG|ALERT|CRIT|ERR|WARNING|NOTICE|INFO|DEBUG
The log level of the XtreemFS client.
.TP
\fB\-h/\-\-help
print help and exit.
.TP
\fB\-l/\-\-log\-file\-path \fIlog_file_path
path to the client log file.


.TP
FUSE OPTIONS:
.TP
\fB\-\-fuse\-debug
Enable FUSE debug output. 
.TP
\fB\-f/\-\-foreground
Run the client process in the foreground (blocks the shell until the volume is un-mounted).
.TP
\fB\-\-enable\-fuse\-cache
Enabling the fuse cache results in improved performance while loosing some POSIX semantics.
.TP
\fB\-\-disable\-fuse\-permission\-check 
Disables fuse POSIX permission checks so all permission checks are exclusively handled by XtreemFS. This flag is required for volumes not using POSIX permission checking.  
.TP
\fB\-o \fIfuse_option
Additional parameters that are passed to FUSE.


.TP
OPTIMIZATION / CACHING OPTIONS:
.TP
\fB\-\-readdir\-chunk\-size \fIsize
Readdir calls are divides into chunks of this size. 
.TP
\fB\-\-file\-size\-updates\-s \fIseconds
The time to cache update\-file\-size calls in seconds when the file is opened. All file size updates are send to the MRC when the file is closed.

.TP
\fB\-\-metadata\-cache\-size \fIsize
The maximal size of the metadata cache for stat information and xattributes.
.TP
\fB\-\-metadata\-cache\-ttl\-s \fIseconds
An entry in the metadata cache is invalidated after this time period.

.TP
\fB\-\-write\-back\-cache
Enables write-back caching in the client for update-file-size calls.
.TP
\fB\-\-write\-through\-cache
Enables write-through caching in the client for update-file-size calls.

.TP
\fB\-t/\-\-operation\-timeout\-s \fIseconds
The request timeout in seconds.
.TP
\fB\-\-user\-group\-monitor\-m \fIminutes
Changes to local users and groups are monitored this often in minutes.

.TP
\fB\-\-retry\-count \fIcount
Number of retries in case of a failure.

.TP
\fB\-\-write\-ahead\-size \fIsize 
The size of the parallel send writes-operations for each stripe in kB. If this is too large, the OSD might become flooded resulting in timeouts in the client.


.TP
SSL OPTIONS:
.TP
\fB\-\-pem\-certificate\-file\-path \fIcertfile
PEM certificate file path (for SSL installations only).
.TP
\fB\-\-pem\-private\-key\-passphrase \fIpass
PEM private key passphrase (for SSL installations only).
.TP
\fB\-\-pkcs12\-file\-path \fIfile
PKCS#12 file path (for SSL installations only).
.TP
\fB\-\-pkcs12\-passphrase \fIpass
PKCS#12 file passphrase (for SSL installations only).
.TP
\fB\-\-pem\-private\-key\-file\-path \fIfile
PEM private key file path.

.TP
\fB\-\-globus\-gridmap
Enable authorization using globus gridmap file.
.TP
\fB\-\-unicore\-gridmap
Enable authorization using unicore gridmap (uudb) file.
.TP
\fB\-\-gridmap\-location \fIfile
The Location of the gridmap file. unicore default: /etc/grid-security/grid-mapfile  globus default: /etc/grid-security/d-grid_uudb

.TP
\fB\-\-trace\-network\-operations
trace network operations
.TP
\fB\-\-trace\-volume\-operations
trace volume operations


.TP
VIVALDI OPTIONS:
.TP
\fB\-\-vivaldi\-coordinates\-file\-path \fIpath

.SH "KNOWN ISSUES"
FUSE does not support mmap in connection with direct I/O. In order to get applications running on XtreemFS that rely on mmap, volumes have to be mounted without using the FUSE option
.B "-o direct_io"
. However, this might lead to inconsistencies if different clients access a file concurrently, as requests might be serviced from the local page cache.

When run on older Linux kernels (2.6.18 or earlier), the XtreemFS client might fail to enforce access control when changing to a directory. The problem can be solved by passing \fB"-o default_permissions"\fR to FUSE.

.SH AVAILABILITY
The mount.xtreemfs command is part of the XtreemFS-client package and is available from \fIhttp://www.xtreemfs.org\fP.
